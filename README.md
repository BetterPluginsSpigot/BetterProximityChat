## What is BetterProximityChat?
Welcome to BetterProximityChat, a server in which you are only able to chat with nearby players, thus giving a more realistic feel to Minecraft. Personalise your experience by configuring the maximum communication range and turning the plugin on or off in game. If nobody is within range, your message will be dropped. On the other hand, if there are other players nearby, you will be notified with the exact amount, but their identities will remain secret. Subsequently, your message will be send to those unknown players.

## New feature (v1.0.2):
You can now add noise to your chat environment. Received messages are more likely to contain errors when the sender is further away.

Personalize your experience by ...
- Turning noise on or off
- Setting the degree of the polynomial function used for noise calculation. The higher the degree, the lower the impact
